# bamazon-app

This is an Amazon-like storefront application using MySQL Server and NPM packages.

The app takes in inventory and lets the customer know when inventory has been depleted.

The app should prompt the user with messages.

The app requires NPM packages and a package JSON to work properly in the command line.

So far, I am not able to get this app functioning properly.
